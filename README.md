# Sharebike

A minimalist vue app to display bikes on a map with their status.

## Env file

NUXT_ENV_BOX_ID = the id for the reached url from jsonbox.io populated with bikes data
NUXT_ENV_MAPBOX = mapbox dev key for displaying the map


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

### TODO

Group the points by clustering them : https://blog.mapbox.com/clustering-properties-with-mapbox-and-html-markers-bb353c8662ba
Completely out of scope but for a poc it's definetely obligatory.
